# AgoraLens: Decentralized Community Platform

## Project Vision

AgoraLens is a feature-rich, decentralized forum and community platform inspired by Discord and Telegram, built on top of the Lens Protocol and Lens Chain. The platform empowers users to create, discover, and participate in on-chain communities ("Groups") with dedicated discussion channels ("Feeds"), enabling rich content sharing and social interactionâ€”all while preserving user ownership and control.

## Core Objective for Developers

This application is designed for developers participating in the Lens Hackathon. Your goal is to deliver a seamless and engaging user experience for on-chain community interaction. AgoraLens deeply integrates Lens social primitives to manage group memberships, content, and social graphs, ensuring that all interactions are transparently and immutably recorded on Lens Chain.

- **Create and manage Groups:** Users can create new communities, set group metadata, and upload group icons.
- **Join and participate:** Discover and join groups, post messages, and share content in dedicated feeds.
- **On-chain social graph:** All group memberships, posts, and interactions are managed and stored on-chain via Lens Protocol.
- **Decentralized and composable:** Built with composability in mind, allowing easy integration with other Lens-based apps and tools.

AgoraLens aims to showcase the power of decentralized social infrastructure, providing a modern, open alternative to traditional chat and forum platforms.
